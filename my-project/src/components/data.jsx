Pure and minimalist, it's a timeless design that sets your diamond or coloured stone centre stage, with no additional flourishes to detract from its beauty. If you are looking for an engagement ring that combines simplicity and elegance, the solitaire setting is a true classic.",

These  elegant rows of accent diamonds add extra detail to simple solitaire  settings and their subtle flashes of scintillation are the perfect  complement to the sparkly halo engagement ring setting.",

Placing a halo of smaller diamonds around a centre stone to form an intensely sparkly frame creates another layer of brilliance and has the effect of making the  diamond appear larger. For even more impact, a diamond-set band works magnificently with this setting.",

A stylish alternative to a solitaire engagement ring, a trio of diamonds set in a row is a classic three stone look, while a central diamond accompanied by two coloured stones on either side is a vibrant alternative. The side stones are more than simple embellishment. They guide the eye to the central stone and  enhance its brilliance.",
